Hi,

My name is Alicia and these are my 12 fave problems:

When is it too much effort?

When do you determine an achivement?

Is there any way to know what really was the original story?

(Making it more specific and a lot of silencing towards minorities)

Am I making things accessible for my peers?

When do I apologize for my harshness in arguments?

Am I making the most of my resources offered in college in order to further network connections for my future?

Are my future wants in my personal life, things that I include in my current life?

Is this the educational legacy I want to have?

Am I putting a good life example for my brothers?

Am i doing all I can do to insure my success for my career goals for the future?

Am I actually succeeding in connecting my academic questions?

Should i think on my own or think with others?

Add some jobs ones
