Hi! I'm **Elinai Alicia Severiano Perez** (she/her), a passionate student double majoring in **Data Science & Educational Studies** at Macalester College (Class of '26). I love working with data, especially to uncover patterns and develop solutions for our small world. Through my coursework and research positions, I’ve gained hands-on experience in data science, analytics, and machine learning algorithms. 

Currently, **I am conducting analytical research** in Mérida, Yucatán, exploring insights into the Southeast Asian immigrant community in Mexico with the limited data available.

Please check out my Projects tab to learn more about my skills and see examples of my work.

## Education
Macalester College | St. Paul MN <br>
Majors in Data Science and Educational Studies | Expected Graduation Date: Spring 2026


## About me
Before college, I danced Mexican **Ballet Folklorico** for six years, which still holds a special place in my heart. The picture above was taken at my college in the fall of '23, where I danced one last time. Additionally, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge by teaching young elementary students regional Mexican dances in Minnesota. I truly love learning about my culture (Hense me studying abroad in Mexico (Fall '24)) and passing that knowledge on to others!

Outside of coding, I’m committed to fostering a safe and welcoming environment for students like me. This dedication is reflected in my roles on my college's **Latinx Student Union** board and the **Student Advisory Board for MSCS** (Math, Statistics, and Computer Science). 

If you're curious about the ideas I’m constantly exploring, check out my Questions tab to see what thoughts linger in my mind daily.
