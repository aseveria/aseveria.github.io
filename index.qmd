## About me
I am from Bensenville, Illinois. Prior to college, I danced Mexican Ballet Folklorico for six years, which still holds a special place in my heart. My culture and roots are really important to me, and I try to showcase it as much as possible. My picture was taken before a Latinx showcase at my college this past year, where I danced Folklorico one last time.*

Outside of coding, I also strive to work on creating a safe and welcoming environment for students like me: BIPOC, Low-Income, Latina,  and children of immigrants. 



If you want to get an idea of what I am constantly thinking click on my Questions tab to see what questions linger on my mind daily.
