    "text": "In collaboration with two classmates in our intro to data science course, we centered our final project around differences in declared majors at Macalester College between Men and Woman\nWe did a lot of data wrangling to find answers to our question, which was, is there a difference between men and woman, in terms of majors/field one joins and has this changed throughout time. Below will be my code for my parts in this project\n**Products**\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'plotly'\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n    last_plot\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n    filter\nThe following object is masked from 'package:graphics':\n    layout\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nmajordata &lt;- read_csv(\"majordatacopy.csv\")\n\nRows: 2444 Columns: 64\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (12): grad_year, sex, first_gen, admit_type, major1, major2, major3, maj...\ndbl (52): StudentID, terms_enrl_ct, studied_away, major_ct, maj_Art, maj_Mus...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n**Major Divisions**\nFor this part I looked into the five major divisions: Social Sciences, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Humanities, Interdisciplinary, and Fine Arts. I compared them over the years and a graph for women and one for men.\n\nmajordata14 &lt;- majordata %&gt;%\n  select(grad_year, major1_division ,sex) %&gt;%\n    filter(sex==\"F\")%&gt;%\n  na.omit() %&gt;%\n  group_by(grad_year, major1_division) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total = sum(n())) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percentage = 100*total/sum(total)) \n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'grad_year'.
