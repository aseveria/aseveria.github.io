In collaboration with another classmate in our intermediate data science course, we centered our final project around the question, what does a classroom look like in the state of Minnesota?

We did a lot of web scrapping, data-visualizations, and collaboration to make this project come together. Our website is interactive so have fun learning about the differences in education per county.
