"   The American Federation of Teachers ended its annual convention here today amid growing expectation that the school reform movement would expand beyond elementary and secondary schools to teachers' colleges.    ''There is no question but that it will lead to criticism of the education that prospective teachers are getting,'' said Albert Shanker, who was elected today to his sixth two-year term as president of the teachers' union.    ''Some criticism will be fair and some will not,'' Mr. Shanker said. ''The thing that works against the colleges is that there are some two million teachers, most of whom have negative things to say about whether the education they got was helpful. A doctor might criticize medical education, but he would not say he would be better off without his professional training, as a teacher would.''",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/24/us/federation-calls-for-better-teacher-training.html,,The American Federation of Teachers ended its annual convention here today amid growing expectation that the school reform movement would expand beyond elementary and secondary schools to teachers' colleges.,A,26,The New York Times,1984-08-24T05:00:00+0000,article,National Desk,U.S.,News,nyt://article/2bc41d5c-8961-5345-a00b-53059c5abb22,602,nyt://article/2bc41d5c-8961-5345-a00b-53059c5abb22,NA,FEDERATION CALLS FOR BETTER TEACHER TRAINING,NA,NA,FEDERATION CALLS FOR BETTER TEACHER TRAINING,NA,NA,NA,By Gene I.

Wilder, of Columbine High School in the Denver suburb  of Littleton, was suspended in March 1995 just days after he showed parts of the film to his senior-level Logic and Debate class.

"  Ordinarily, a teachers' union leader like John P. O'Sullivan would be delighted to see his school district raise salaries, but he is not very happy about the merit pay plan that is the basis of the higher pay scale in Houston.   ''The whole program starts out with the concept that some groups of teachers are not meriters and some are,'' said Mr. O'Sullivan, the president of the Houston Federation of Teachers.   Merit pay, often proposed in combination with a plan for designating recipients as ''master teachers,'' is a concept for improving salaries and making teaching more attractive. But where plans have been proposed, as well as in the few school districts like Houston and Los Angeles that have used the approach, elation over greater earnings is often overshadowed by reservations involving the process.

"   The Education Department said today that the number of students dropping out of high school had risen sharply from 1972 to 1982.    The Secretary of Education, T. H. Bell, said in making public the results of a department study that the increase had occurred despite a period of increased spending on schools.   The researchers drew together for the first time a number of educational indicators under a state-by-state breakdown that compared data for 1982 with that for 1972.   The survey showed that the rate nationwide of students graduating from high school had dropped to 72.8 percent in 1982, from 77.2 percent in 1972.

"  Education is emerging as a major issue in the 1984 Presidential campaign, and so far the debate is being shaped by President Reagan and Walter F. Mondale, the Democrat who is expected to win the endorsement of the nation's largest teacher organization.   Mr. Mondale has delivered two major speeches attacking what he called the ''voodoo education'' policies of the Reagan Administration, hitting hard on Mr. Reagan's proposals to reduce the Federal education budget.   The President has moved swiftly to establish his position in the debate as favoring a return to the basics in education and merit pay for teachers, positions that his aides say reflect a popular view.  Mr. Reagan is planning a series of speeches on education, the first on Thursday in Hopkins, Minn., at a regional forum to discuss the report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education.   It was that commission, created by the President, that brought the issue to the forefront of the political debate with an urgency not felt since the first Soviet space satellite shook American confidence in its public schools in 1957. In its recent report, the commission found a ''rising tide of mediocrity in the nation's schools'' and called for tougher academic standards, higher pay for teachers, more homework, stricter discipline and other changes in public education.",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/09/us/education-emerges-as-major-issue-in-1984-presidential-campaigning.html,,"Education is emerging as a major issue in the 1984 Presidential campaign, and so far the debate is being shaped by President Reagan and Walter F.

"  Supporters and opponents of President Reagan's proposal to give tax relief to the parents of children in private schools disagreed sharply over whether today's Supreme Court decision would improve the chances for Congressional approval of the legislation.   On the one hand, Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, who guided the proposal through the Finance Committee, said the High Court's decision would ''help passage of the President's legislation.'' Charles J. O'Malley, an aide to T.@H. Bell, the Secretary of Education, said the ruling ''can't do anything but help us'' in the effort to win approval for a bill authorizing tax credits for tuition paid to private schools.   The American Federation of Teachers, representing more than 580,000 school employees, strongly opposes tuition tax credits.

"  President Reagan acknowledged today that his proposal to have teachers paid and promoted on the basis of merit would cost more money, but he said that school systems should pay for the program by cutting other programs of ''much lower priority.''    He did not specify what these low-priority school programs were.  Speaking in this Minneapolis suburb at a forum sponsored by his National Commission on Excellence in Education, Mr. Reagan once again appealed for steps to improve educational quality without increasing Federal spending. Asserting that spending on education had ''nearly doubled'' in the last 20 years, after taking account of inflation, Mr. Reagan said, ''You have to say, 'Is just purely money an answer, or don't we have to look deeper for some of the answers to the problems we have in education?' ''   Mr. Reagan also suggested that his own generation bore some responsibility for lax standards in education. ''I just have a feeling that maybe the generation that went through the Great Depression and the Great War and World War II, maybe we thought that we ought to make things easier for our children,'' he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/10/us/reagan-acknowledges-cost-of-schools-proposals.html,,"President Reagan acknowledged today that his proposal to have teachers paid and promoted on the basis of merit would cost more money, but he said that school systems should pay for the program by cutting other programs of ''much lower priority.''",B,11,The New York Times,1983-06-10T05:00:00+0000,article,National Desk,U.S.,News,nyt://article/adf49667-fe9f-5d8c-aa43-c3ea5c05d1a7,1328,nyt://article/adf49667-fe9f-5d8c-aa43-c3ea5c05d1a7,NA,REAGAN ACKNOWLEDGES COST OF SCHOOLS PROPOSALS,NA,NA,REAGAN ACKNOWLEDGES COST OF SCHOOLS PROPOSALS,NA,NA,NA,By Steven R.

In the last few years, teachers of all subjects and at all grade levels have begun to concentrate on writing in the classroom. As the cry has gone up for a stronger emphasis on writing in the schools, the notion of ''writing across the curriculum,'' as it is called, has spread across the United States, Britain and Canada.   ''The idea,'' said Cynthia O'Nore, who runs a consulting firm called The Write Company, ''is not to teach writing per se but to teach the subject matter'' - to teach social studies, as Mr. Gallino does, by having students write about social studies, math by having them create word problems, or science by having them write, and think, like scientists.
