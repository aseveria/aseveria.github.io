"  A new approach to medical education, intended to cut down on lecture classes, minimize memorization and ease the pressure on undergraduates hoping to get into medical school, was proposed yesterday by a panel sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges.    The recommendations, in the association's first major report on medical education since 1932, also call for future physicians to get a broader education in nonscientific areas and for faculty members to improve the clinical training of students in medical school.   In calm but acerbic language about current medical education, the report, ''Physicians for the Twenty-First Century,'' offers proposals that would alter the entire process of selecting undergraduates for medical school and of training them to deal with the needs of patients.    ''The panel does not choose to invoke the hysterical hyperbole of crsis; nor do we wish to impugn the high quality of much that is being done,'' said Dr. Steven Muller, chairman of the panel. ''However, we perceive a continuing erosion of general education for physicians, an erosion that has not been arrested but is instead accelerating.''",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/20/us/broader-education-for-medical-students-proposed.html,,"A new approach to medical education, intended to cut down on lecture classes, minimize memorization and ease the pressure on undergraduates hoping to get into medical school, was proposed yesterday by a panel sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",B,16,The New York Times,1984-09-20T05:00:00+0000,article,National Desk,U.S.,NA,News,nyt://article/ef3075d5-b2e6-5d6c-81e1-67360272882e,968,nyt://article/ef3075d5-b2e6-5d6c-81e1-67360272882e,BROADER EDUCATION FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS PROPOSED,NA,NA,BROADER EDUCATION FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS PROPOSED,NA,NA,NA,By Gene I.

"  Another round of hefty tuition increases at colleges and universities around the country has ushered in the era of the $50,000 bachelor's degree. It has also suggested that educators and legislators are moving to shift a greater percentage of the cost of higher education onto students.   Private colleges are typically raising tuition and fees for the 1982-83 academic year by 12 to 16 percent. This is slightly below last year's record increases but still about twice the current rate of inflation.   The major reasons cited for the increases include efforts to catch up in the areas of faculty salaries and maintenance, where spending has lagged behind the inflation rate in recent years, and the need to cover the gaps left by the Reagan Administration's cuts in Federal tuition assistance.",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/us/rise-in-tuitions-signals-shift-on-college-costs-to-students.html,,"Another round of hefty tuition increases at colleges and universities around the country has ushered in the era of the $50,000 bachelor's degree.
